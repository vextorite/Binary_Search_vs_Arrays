# Binary_Search_vs_Arrays
A comparison of Binary Search Trees with traditional Arrays

LSBSTApp is a Binary Search Tree Program that returns the areas experiencing loadshedding for the given parameters.
If the parameters are not valid, then "Invalid Parameters" is returned. Not parsing any parameters will retuen a list of all stages, days, times, and areas experiencing loadshedding
    

To run:

```java LSBSTApp <stage> <day> <time>```    #To return areas experiencing load shedding for the given parameters

```java LSBSTApp```                         #To return all areas and details


LSArrayApp is a program that returns areas experiencing loadshedding for the given parameters provided that they are valid. Not parsing any parameters returns a list of stages, days, times and areas experiencing loadshedding.

```java LSArrayApp <stage> <day> <time>```    #To return areas experiencing load shedding for the given parameters

```java LSArrayApp```                         #To return all areas and details
